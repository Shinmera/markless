\sectiondef{Documents}
Markless describes a number of \gpl{directive} to transform a \g{document} from its bare \g{string} representation into that of a \g{textual component}. While the \gpl{directive} are described in this specification using UTF-8 \gpl{character}, the specification does not enforce any particular \g{encoding} on the \g{document}. However, in order for an \g{implementation} to be \glink{conforming implementation}{conforming}, \gpl{character} used to identify a \g{directive} in a \g{document} must be \g{equivalent} to those in this specification.
