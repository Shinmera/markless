Embeds the audio file pointed to by the \inline$target$ into the document. The supported audio formats are \g{implementation dependant}. If the format of the target is not supported by the \g{implementation}, the \g{directive} is treated as if it were given an unknown type. The \g{resulting textual component} must be interactive in such a way that the \g{user} is presented with a way to start, pause, seek, and change the volume of the audio. The audio track should not play automatically, unless the \ident{embed-property-autoplay} flag property is present. If the \ident{embed-property-loop} flag property is present, the audio track should start over from the beginning once it reaches the end. Since an audio file does not have any dimensions associated with it, the \g{implementation} is free to choose the sizing it deems appropriate. \\
