\definesection{Line Directives}
In order for a \g{directive} to be a \g{line directive}, its \g{identifier} must \g{match} the beginning of a \g{line} and either the end of a \g{line} or the beginning of a different \g{line}. Thus the \g{identifier} of each \g{line directive} only matches at the beginning of a \g{line}.\\

A \g{textual component} specified by a \g{line directive} can potentially contain any other \g{textual component}. Therefore, any \g{directive} is potentially recognisable within a \g{line directive}, including other \gpl{line directive}. However, a \g{line directive} may explicitly restrict which \gpl{directive} are recognised within itself.
