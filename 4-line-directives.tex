\definesection{Line Directives}
In order for a \g{directive} to be a \g{line directive}, its \g{identifier} must \g{match} the beginning of a \g{line} and either the end of a \g{line} or the beginning of a different \g{line}. Thus the \g{identifier} of each \g{line directive} only matches at the beginning of a \g{line}.\\

A \g{textual component} specified by a \g{line directive} can potentially contain any other \g{textual component}. Therefore, any \g{directive} is potentially recognisable within a \g{line directive}, including other \gpl{line directive}. However, a \g{line directive} may explicitly restrict which \gpl{directive} are recognised within itself. A \g{line directive} cannot cross the boundaries of another \g{line directive} of a different kind. If such a case were to occur, the current \g{line directive} is forcibly ended without regard for any possible trailing \g{match}.

\definesubsubsection{Singular Line Directives}
A \g{line directive} is a \g{singular line directive} if it is only ever active for a single \g{line}. If it is matched on two consecutive \gpl{line} this results in two separate \gpl{resulting textual component}.

\definesubsubsection{Spanning Line Directives}
A \g{line directive} is a \g{spanning line directive} if the \g{identifier} contains a \g{content binding}, and if \glink{match}{matches} on consecutive \gpl{line} of the \g{identifier} are interpreted as a single \g{match}. The semantics of such a spanning match are as follows: Only a single \g{resulting textual component} is produced for all the consecutively \glink{match}{matching} \gpl{line}. The \g{text} of this \g{resulting textual component} is produced by concatenating the contents of the \g{content binding} on each \g{line}. If the \g{content binding} does not \g{match} the \g{newline} on every \g{line}, the \g{newline} must be inserted between each \g{string} of the \g{content binding}.

\definesubsubsection{Guarded Line Directives}
A \g{line directive} is a \g{guarded line directive} if its \glink{match}{matched} region is specified by two \gpl{identifier} that each match a single \g{line}. The \g{text} of the \g{resulting textual component} is the \g{text} from the \g{line} immediately after the \g{line} the first \g{identifier} \glink{match}{matches} until and including the \g{line} immediately before the \g{line} the second \g{identifier} \glink{match}{matches}.
