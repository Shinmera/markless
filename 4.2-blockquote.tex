The blockquote header always spans exactly the line it is \glink{match}{matched} at. Only the \inline{header} of the line is outputted into the \g{resulting textual component}. The blockquote header can only contain \gpl{inline directive}. \\

The blockquote body spans for as long as the blockquote body \g{identifier} \glink{match}{matches}. Only the \inline{content} of each line is outputted into the \g{resulting textual component}. The blockquote body can contain any \g{directive} with the condition that the \gpl{directive} are matched against the \g{text} of the \g{resulting textual component}. In essence this means that the beginning of the line prefix required to \g{match} the \g{identifier} is not considered for inner \gpl{directive}.
