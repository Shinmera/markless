Markless is a text based markup language intended for simple document and comment publications.

# Markless Example
While "this document itself"(link README.mess) is written in Markless and may serve as a tutorial, a brief example follows. Hopefully it is self-explanatory.

:: markless
! set line-break-mode hide

Markless is structured visually and all its markup is intended to be
intuitive. As such, it should be relatively easy to get used to.

The above exclamation mark line might be a bit mysterious,
however. That's an instruction that tells Markless to hide line
breaks, allowing you to add line breaks to your text without the
resulting document having strange line breaks everywhere.

## Lists
Lists in Markless come in two ways -- ordered and unordered. To
exemplify this, here's a recipe for crepes:

- 1 Egg
- Flour
- Milk
- Filling. I recommend:
  - Cinnamon
  - Sugar

1. Mix the egg, flour, and milk together until you get a sticky
   dough.
2. Heat up a pan. Once hot, pour some of the dough and spread it with
   spatulas across the pan's surface.
3. Once you can lift up the side of the now hardened dough, flip it
   over.
4. Spread some sugar and cinnamon over the dough, and wait until the
   underside is nicely baked.
5. Fold the dough once or twice and serve.

Evidently, lists can be nested and span multiple lines given the
proper indentation.

## Text Styling
Markless offers a lot of ways to style text like //italic//, **bold**,
__underline__, <-strikethrough->, ``literal``, v(subtext), and
^(supertext). These styles can all be nested in each other to be
combined.

Further styles, and combination of styles is also possible with the
"cmpound markup"(italic, bold). This compound markup also allows "font
changing"(font Impact), "coloring"(blue), "sizing"(small),
"linking"(https://example.com), and "hidden text"(spoiler).

## Other Things
Aside from this, Markless also offers embedding of images, audio, and
video, footnotes[1], blockquotes, code blocks, and some less often
seen things like comments and instructions.

# Feature List
Markless spots the following features:

- Basic blocks like paragraphs, blockquotes, lists, section headers, horizontal rules, and code blocks.
- Embedding of images, audio, and video.
- Text markup for bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, supertext, subtext, spoilers, code, and font family, size, and colour.
- Automatic URL markup and linking.
- Section cross-referencing.
- Instructions to alter the parsing behaviour from within the document, and to set metadata.
- Both explicit and implicit line breaks.
- A standards document that specifies the language clearly.

# Markless Resources
The primary resource for Markless is its standards document, which can be found in LaTeX source form "here"(https://github.com/shirakumo/markless) and compiled to PDF "here"(https://github.com/Shirakumo/markless/raw/master/markless.pdf).

## Markless Implementations
This is a list of known implementations of the Markless standard. If you develop your own implementation, please "let us know"() so that we can add it.

- "cl-markless"(https://shirakumo.github.io/cl-markless/) An implementation in Common Lisp, available as a library and a standalone executable.
