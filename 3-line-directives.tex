\sectiondef{Line Directives}
In order for a \g{directive} to be a \g{line directive}, it must be identifiable by the first few \gpl{character} of the \g{line} it starts at. The \g{textual component} associated with a \g{line directive} always starts at the beginning of the \g{line} of the \g{line directive} and spans until the end of a \g{line}. It may span more than one \g{line}.
