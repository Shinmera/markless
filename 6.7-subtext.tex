Subtext is a \g{surrounding inline directive}. It marks the \g{text} to belong to a \g{textual component} that sets the style of the text to appear smaller and below the default text line. Only the \g{text} held by the \g{content binding} is outputted to the \g{resulting textual component}. The length of the \g{text} held by the \inline$start$ and \inline$end$ \gpl{binding} must be the same in order for the \ident{subtext} \g{identifier} to \g{match}.\\
