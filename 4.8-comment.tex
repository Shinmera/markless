\definesubsection{Comment}
\begin{identifier}{comment}

The comment is a \g{singular line directive}. If the \ident{comment} \g{identifier} is \glink{match}{matched}, the entire line is skipped and discarded. There is no corresponding \g{resulting textual component} for the comment \g{directive} and as such it must not have any effect on the \g{document}. \\
