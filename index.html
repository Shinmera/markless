Markless is structured visually and all its markup is intended to be
intuitive. As such, it should be relatively easy to get used to.

The above exclamation mark line might be a bit mysterious,
however. That's an instruction that tells Markless to hide line
breaks, allowing you to add line breaks to your text without the
resulting document having strange line breaks everywhere.

## Lists
Lists in Markless come in two ways -- ordered and unordered. To
exemplify this, here's a recipe for crepes:

- 1 Egg
- Flour
- Milk
- Filling. I recommend:
  - Cinnamon
  - Sugar

1. Mix the egg, flour, and milk together until you get a sticky
   dough.
2. Heat up a pan. Once hot, pour some of the dough and spread it with
   spatulas across the pan's surface.
3. Once you can lift up the side of the now hardened dough, flip it
   over.
4. Spread some sugar and cinnamon over the dough, and wait until the
   underside is nicely baked.
5. Fold the dough once or twice and serve.

Evidently, lists can be nested and span multiple lines given the
proper indentation.

## Text Styling
Markless offers a lot of ways to style text like //italic//, **bold**,
__underline__, &lt;-strikethrough-&gt;, ``literal``, v(subtext), and
^(supertext). These styles can all be nested in each other to be
combined.

Further styles, and combination of styles is also possible with the
&quot;cmpound markup&quot;(italic, bold). This compound markup also allows &quot;font
changing&quot;(font Impact), &quot;coloring&quot;(blue), &quot;sizing&quot;(small),
&quot;linking&quot;(https://example.com), and &quot;hidden text&quot;(spoiler).

## Other Things
Aside from this, Markless also offers embedding of images, audio, and
video, footnotes[1], blockquotes, code blocks, and some less often
seen things like comments and instructions.
