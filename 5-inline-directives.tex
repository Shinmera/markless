\definesection{Inline Directives}
A \g{directive} is an \g{inline directive} if its identification is not bound to \gpl{line}. Unlike \gpl{line directive} therefore it can potentially be identified at any point in a string and span any length. \\

Any \g{textual component} specified by an \g{inline directive} can only contain \gpl{textual component} specified by \gpl{inline directive}. Thus, only \gpl{inline directive} are recognised within an \g{inline directive}.
