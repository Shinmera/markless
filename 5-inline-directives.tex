\definesection{Inline Directives}
A \g{directive} is an \g{inline directive} if its identification is not bound to \gpl{line}. Unlike \gpl{line directive} therefore it can potentially be identified at any point in a string and span any length. \\

Any \g{textual component} specified by an \g{inline directive} can only contain \gpl{textual component} specified by \gpl{inline directive}. Furthermore, an \g{inline directive} cannot contain another \g{inline directive} of its own type at any \g{level}. An \g{inline directive} may further restrict which \gpl{directive} may appear within itself.

\definesubsubsection{Surrounding Inline Directives}
An \g{inline directive} is an \g{surrounding inline directive} if its \g{identifier} is terminated by a \syntax{binding-reference} to a \syntax{binding} at the start of the \g{identifier}. The \g{resulting textual component} of a \g{surrounding inline directive} never contains the \gpl{string} \glink{match}{matched} by the \g{identifier}'s starting \syntax{binding}. Instead, each \g{surrounding inline directive} \g{identifier} contains a \g{content binding} that matches all the \g{text} that the \g{resulting textual component} will contain.

\definesubsubsection{Entity Inline Directives}
An \g{inline directive} is an \g{entity inline directive} if its \g{identifier} does not contain any \syntax{binding}s and instead the \g{text} of the \g{resulting textual component} is entirely dependant on the \g{entity inline directive} specification.

\definesubsubsection{Compound Inline Directives}
An \g{inline directive} is a \g{compound inline directive} if its \g{identifier} consists of multiple \syntax{binding}s the contents of which are in some form outputted to the \g{resulting textual component}.
